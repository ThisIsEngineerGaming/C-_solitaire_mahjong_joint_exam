# Mahjong Solitaire – C# Windows Forms Project

## 🎮 Project Overview
This project is a **Mahjong Solitaire game** developed in **C# using Windows Forms** as part of a joint programming exam.  
The goal of the game is to match identical free tiles and remove them from the board until no moves remain.

The project demonstrates **object-oriented programming**, **advanced C# features**, **SOLID principles**, **design patterns**, and **persistent data storage**.

## ✅ Used Programming Elements

### 🔹 Core C# Language Features
- ✅ Classes and Objects
- ✅ Methods and Functions
- ✅ Constructors
- ✅ The `this` keyword
- ✅ Access Modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)
- ✅ Properties (`get` / `set`)
- ✅ Indexers (`this[int index]`)
- ✅ Operator Overloading (`+` operator)
- ✅ Enums
- ✅ Exception Handling (`try-catch`)
- ✅ Events and Delegates
- ✅ Static Members
- ✅ Generic Types (`List<T>`, `IEnumerable<T>`)

---

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ✅ **Encapsulation** – Private fields with public properties
- ✅ **Inheritance** – Tile subtypes inherit from base `Tile` class
- ✅ **Polymorphism** – Virtual and overridden methods
- ✅ **Interfaces** – `ISaveable` interface implemented

---

### 🔹 Collections & Data Processing
- ✅ `List<T>`
- ✅ `IEnumerable<T>`
- ✅ Custom Collections (`TileCollection`)
- ✅ LINQ:
  - `Where`
  - `ToList`
  - `Repeat`

---

### 🔹 File System & Serialization
- ✅ File Creation & Reading
- ✅ JSON Serialization
- ✅ JSON Deserialization
- ✅ Persistent Save & Load System

---

### 🔹 Windows Forms & UI
- ✅ Forms
- ✅ Buttons
- ✅ Panels
- ✅ Mouse Events
- ✅ Custom Images for Tiles
- ✅ Application Icon
- ✅ Window Titles
- ✅ Background Images

---

### 🔹 Design Patterns Used
- ✅ **Strategy Pattern** – Tile comparers via `IComparer<Tile>`

---

### 🔹 SOLID Principles
- ✅ **S – Single Responsibility Principle**
- ✅ **O – Open/Closed Principle**
- ✅ **L – Liskov Substitution Principle**
- ✅ **I – Interface Segregation Principle**
- ✅ **D – Dependency Inversion Principle**
